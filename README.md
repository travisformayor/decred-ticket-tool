## Notes

- You can find your ticket address in your tickets tab by the pool info
- Doesn't work for ticket addresses with over 8,000 transactions
- ROI is an estimate that only works for accounts that didn't have a major change to the amount of funds staked over time (unless that change was from staking rewards, which it can take into account).
